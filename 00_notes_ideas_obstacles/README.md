# 20221208 - Project Start
I am not sure where to start this project, yet. I guess it makes sense to clearly define the objectives first. As I am a stakeholder and interested in the solution myself I will start framing the target solution through the eyes of a goalkeeper coach. 
## Defining the objective - viewpoint: stakeholder
As a goalkeeper coach I am interested in improving a goalkeepers performance. I do this by regularly and properly training. Each goalkeeper training has certain focus topics, where I try to work on 
specific attributes of a goalkeeper, e.g. safety of catch, feetwork, jumping power or reaction. 

As a coach my work on the pitch focuses mainly on leading the goalkeepers through the exercises and to make sure that the exercises have the right intensity and difficulty and correct exercise execution to prevent injuries and improve skills.

This is not an easy task. Watching intensity and execution while having to shoot balls and managing the other goalkeepers is intense and requires high attention all the time. Especially when learning new techniques where it is required to watch the execuiton of the exercise closely while shooting or throwing balls for the goalkeeper. For this reason, it is essential for any goalkeeper coach to film and create videos of the training sessions. The videos provide detailed insights, which could never be gathered during training because the execution speed of the exercises is much too high to see the needed details.

Then after each goalkeeper training session it requires a huge amount of time to cut and edit the videos and then sending them to the goalkeepers to give them tips on how to improve based on the insights provided by the videos. Therefore, it would be nice to have this process automated. 

The detailed idea is the following: 
* A video is provided, which contains one or more exercises performed by the goalkeepers
*
